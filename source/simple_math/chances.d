	Finds the chance of `value` shares falling out of `from`.

		value = (`T`) Number of shares from `from`.
		Ð°from = (`T`) Absolute value (100% relative to `value`).

	Returns: A number of type identical to the type of other parameters.

	Throws: `Error` if value lower than 0 or greater than `from`.

	Note: 
		This functiuon is similar to `T percents(T)(T value, T from)` 
		function from `percents.d` module and later will be deprecated.
